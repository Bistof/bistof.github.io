  <p>When I was a little boy growing up in Singapore, I always and even now LOVE birdsüê¶. My parents would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up and I would say without hesitation that I wanted to be a bird. I was always fascinated by their ability to fly and loved watching them fly, glide, and soar.</p>
<p>Now after growing up a bit more I still want to be a bird but I know it would not be possible. The closest thing I could be to birds and flying are planes. That is why now, when I think of what I want to be when I grow up, I think of a PILOT! </p>  
<p>I would be able to fly, glide, and soar over the ground, as we all know, and view the mystical wonders of the sky. Of course, that is just a dream and I am not a pilot but I am hopefully working towards being one. </p>
<p>Since I am kinda too young to really fly yet, I can only dream and learn more about planes.</p>
<p>So I created XPLANE to keep my memories and dreams alive while learning and explaining planes to others who may be similar to me.</p>
  <p> </p>
<p>Well why can't you and others look and read other plane websites?</p>
<p>When I was trying to learn stuff about planes, I realized how there aren't many websites like that and for the few, information can be quite long and complicated. XPLANE is a website about planes where users can find simple and clear info about the planes they love.</p>
