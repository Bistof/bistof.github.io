When I was a little boy growing up in Singapore, I always and even now LOVE birdsüê¶. My parents would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up and I would say without hesitation that I wanted to be a bird. I was always fascinated by their ability to fly and loved watching them fly, glide, and soar.

Now after growing up a bit more I still want to be a bird but I know it would not be possible. The closest thing I could be to birds and flying are planes. That is why now, when I think of what I want to be when I grow up, I think of a PILOT!

I would be able to fly, glide, and soar over the ground, as we all know, and view the mystical wonders of the sky. Of course, that is just a dream and I am not a pilot but I am hopefully working towards being one.

Since I am kinda too young to really fly yet, I can only dream and learn more about planes.

So I created XPLANE to keep my memories and dreams alive while learning and explaining planes to others who may be similar to me.

Well why can't you and others look and read other plane websites?

When I was trying to learn stuff about planes, I realized how there aren't many websites like that and for the few, information can be quite long and complicated. XPLANE is a website about planes where users can find simple and clear info about the planes they love.
